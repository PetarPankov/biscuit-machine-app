### Biscuit machine app

##Requirements:

Design a system to control the Biscuit Machine to the
following specification:

● When switched on, the machine must wait for the
oven to warm up before starting the conveyor belt.
● Biscuits must be cooked at a temperature of 220 -
240°C (the oven will overheat if the heating element is
on all the time).
● If the operator selects “Pause", all movement must be
stopped immediately but the oven should be kept
heated.
● When “Off” is selected, the machine should be shut
down leaving nothing on the conveyor belt.
